		<p>
			Generator is a monthly gathering for creative technologists and curious humans (and the occasional tiny dog). We make time for tinkering and swapping ideas. <br />
			There will probably be crisps. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Our next meeting will be <br />
			üóì on the 11th of March, 2020<br /> 
			‚è∞ 1800 ‚Äî 2100 <br />
			üìç 68 Middle Street. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We don't usually have <em class="presenter">A Presenter</em>, but we do run a show and tell towards the end of the evening. Most of the meeting is project time: a few hours reserved from our busy lives to try new things, cultivate ideas, and experiment with new media.

			We'll probably organise a few field trips throughout the year. Some of us are trying to get tickets for EMF camp ü§û.
		</p>
		<p>
			We don't provide equipment or tutoring, but we have plenty of space, fast wifi, and friendly faces. Come along, whether you have a project you're already working on, want to show something off, or are simply curious about trying out new art things. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In meetings so far people have tinkered with or brought along
			<ul>
				<li>WebGL shaders</li>
				<li>Processing / P5.js</li>
				<li>Homecooked eurorack synth modules</li>
				<li>D3 visualisations</li>
				<li>Network enabled heat-transfer printer projects</li>
				<li>WebMidi</li>
				<li>SVG animations</li>
				<li>VR audio visualisations</li>
				<li>Pen plotter drawings</li>
				<li>Max/MSP video processing</li>
				<li>And more‚Ä¶</li>
			</ul>
			We've also seen projects passed around, and iterated on by other people. Copy-paste the knitting!

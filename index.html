			Generator is a monthly gathering for creative technologists and curious humans (and the occasional tiny dog). We make time for tinkering and swapping ideas. <br />
			There will probably be crisps. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Our next meeting will be <br />
			üóì on the 11th of March, 2020<br /> 
			‚è∞ 1800 ‚Äî 2100 <br />
			üìç 68 Middle Street. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We don't usually have <em class="presenter">A Presenter</em>, but we do run a show and tell towards the end of the evening. Most of the meeting is project time: a few hours reserved from our busy lives to try new things, cultivate ideas, and experiment with new media.

			We'll probably organise a few field trips throughout the year. Some of us are trying to get tickets for EMF camp ü§û.
		</p>
		<p>
			We don't provide equipment or tutoring, but we have plenty of space, fast wifi, and friendly faces. Come along, whether you have a project you're already working on, want to show something off, or are simply curious about trying out new art things. 
		</p>
		<p>

			<ul>
